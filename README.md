# Subsurface-website
Wordpress to GitHub integration of the full Subsurface website, including all translations

.de: Deutch (occasionally, dirkhh)

.en: English (dirkhh, h2sk1, fezzington)

.es: Español (salvadorcunat)

.fr: Français

.it: Italiano

.pl: Polski

.pt-pt: Português

This is still very fragile and doesn't always sync correctly.
Especially if a user is logged into the website in a language other than English, 
things seem to be going wrong when changes are pushed from Wordpress to Github.
